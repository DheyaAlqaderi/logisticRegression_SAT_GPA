# Logistic Regression for College Admission Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a logistic regression model implemented in Python using libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn to predict college admission based on SAT and GPA scores. The model is trained on historical admission data and can be used to predict whether a new student will be admitted or not.

This project serves as a simple example of binary classification using logistic regression. You can adapt and expand upon this code for your own datasets or applications.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of the following columns:
- `SAT Score`: The SAT score of each applicant.
- `Admitted`: The target variable, indicating whether the applicant was admitted (1) or not admitted (0).

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `logistic_regression_admission.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.

## Usage

- Run the code in the Jupyter Notebook to train the logistic regression model on the provided dataset.
- Use the trained model to make predictions for new applicants by providing their SAT scores and GPAs.
