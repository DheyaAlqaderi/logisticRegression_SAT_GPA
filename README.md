# Logistic Regression for College Admission Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a logistic regression model implemented in Python using libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn to predict college admission based on SAT and GPA scores. The model is trained on historical admission data and can be used to predict whether a new student will be admitted or not.

This project serves as a simple example of binary classification using logistic regression. You can adapt and expand upon this code for your own datasets or applications.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of the following columns:
- `SAT Score`: The SAT score of each applicant.
- `GPA`: The GPA of each applicant.
- `Admitted`: The target variable, indicating whether the applicant was admitted (1) or not admitted (0).

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `logistic_regression_admission.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the necessary Python packages and their versions for running the code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/logistic-regression-admission.git

2. Create a Python virtual environment and install the required packages:
cd logistic-regression-admission
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `logistic_regression_admission.ipynb` and follow the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

4. You can also replace the `data.csv` file with your own dataset for similar binary classification tasks.

## Usage

- Run the code in the Jupyter Notebook to train the logistic regression model on the provided dataset.
- Use the trained model to make predictions for new applicants by providing their SAT scores and GPAs.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using various classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. You can use these metrics to assess the model's predictive accuracy and make improvements as needed.
